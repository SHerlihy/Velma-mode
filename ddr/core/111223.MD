##Behaviour

- Wrap the 'VelmaMode' component around desired components
- The desired component will have a spectacles button
- Click the specticles button to enhance the text
- Click the plus and minus buttons to change text size
- Click the spectacles button again to un-enhance the text

Why no mouse enter or mouse leave behaviour?

- When navigating to text through other text elements having the other elements changing their text size is either cool or really annoying/distracting depending on the user
- A user is likely to want to move their mouse/focus away from the element thier looking at to get a better look at it

###Setting perscription on multiple elements

Should the inital perscription of a new element be the original default or the perscription given to the last element?
- Carry on from last
- Common use case would be wanting the same perscription for multiple elements
- Situation where specific similar text is not visable like listis in a footer etc

Issue: Changing current element perscription leading to formatting changes as other element perscriptions are changed

Could ensure wrapper element has fixed dimensions and scroll needed to access test when unseen?
- Preserves the authors original layout in the document
- No more added state to manage

- How do I feel about scroll behaviour?
-- Specifically on keyboard

- Author could specify dimensions too small (not my bad but BUT it is)

Could only update element perscription when element is focused and buttons are pressed?

- Allows user to return to text at prevously defined size
-- User may not at a glance recognize this text if it has been re-enhanced

- Could voilate author layout

I think both respecting author layout and preserving element recognition are primary concerns.

Decision:
- Preserve element recognition by only updating element perscription when element is focused and button is pressed
- Preserve author layout by allowing elements to have fixed dimensions
